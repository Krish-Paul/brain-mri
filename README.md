Implemented a UU-Net-based CNN architecture, achieving a 99.86% accuracy rate and a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9309 for precise brain tumor segmentation, significantly reducing diagnostic variability and enhancing workflow efficiency.
 Applied advanced data augmentation techniques(rotation, flipping, zooming) and custom preprocessing steps, increasing model generalization and reducing overfitting
 Developed and integrated custom loss functions and evaluation metrics, such as the Dice similarity coefficient and IoU,resulting in optimized model training and validation, and ensuring high precision in segmentationÂ tasks.
